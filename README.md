#Genome Browser NG

This project develops genome browser software that builds on game-like user interface design and powerful Java-based OpenGL graphics libraries. The genome browser uses some of the basic principles found from previous similar browser software, but introduces a new kind of user interface that allows significantly more flexible data navigation.
