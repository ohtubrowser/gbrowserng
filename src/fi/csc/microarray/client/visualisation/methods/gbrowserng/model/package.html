		<p>Objects in this package encapsulate data specific to this application. 
			One example is GenoCircle, which represents the genome in the main window. GeneralLink represents a link between two points on the genome. 
			Update or creation of Model object happens through user action in View layer, which is relayed to a Controller object. 
		When a Model object is changed, the corresponding change is shown in View object responsible for showing it.</p>
